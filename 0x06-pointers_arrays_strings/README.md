File 0-strcat.c - a function that concatenates two strings.This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte.Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest.

File 1-strncat.c - a function that concatenates two strings.The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that it will use at most n bytes from src; and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes. Return a pointer to the resulting string dest.
